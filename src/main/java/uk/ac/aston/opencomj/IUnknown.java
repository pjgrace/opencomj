/**
 * The IUnknown interface is a central aspect of OpenCOM. However,
 it is not actually required in the Java version. Standard Interface/Object behaviour
 in Java negates the need for queryInterface. Furthermore, the garbage collector
 means addref and release are not required. However, IUnknown remains in this
 version to present the same (okay similar) programming model to traditional
 OpenCOM.

 Note: QI is an improvement over object casting, like OpenCOM you can detect if the
 interface is available on the component before invoking it. That is, we retain
 one of the programming model benefits of COM.
